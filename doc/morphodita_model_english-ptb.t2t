== English MorphoDiTa Models ==[english-ptb]

English models are created using the following data:
- //SCOWL (Spell Checker Oriented Word Lists)//: This word list is used
  in morphologic generation to create all possible word forms of a given
  word.

Please note that currently you must have LDC licence for Wall Street Journal to
use the English models in MorphoDiTa.

Apart from the mentioned copyrights and licences, the resulting models are
distributed under the [CC BY-NC-SA http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/]
licence. English models work in MorphoDiTa version 1.0.0 or later.

English models are versioned according to the release date, the version
format is ``YYMMDD``, where ``YY``, ``MM`` and ``DD`` are two-digit
representation of year, month and day, respectively. The latest version is
140304.

This work has been using language resources developed and/or stored and/or
distributed by the LINDAT/CLARIN project of the Ministry of Education of the
Czech Republic (project //LM2010013//).

The morphologic POS analyzer development was supported by grant of the Ministry
of Education, Youth and Sports of the Czech Republic No. //LC536// "Center for
Computational Linguistics". The morphological POS analyzer research was
performed by Johanka Spoustová (Spoustová 2008; the ``Treex::Tool::EnglishMorpho::Analysis``
Perl module). The lemmatizer was implemented by Martin Popel (Popel 2009; the
``Treex::Tool::EnglishMorpho::Lemmatizer`` Perl module). The lemmatizer is
based on ``morpha``, which was released under LGPL licence as a part of
[RASP system http://ilexir.co.uk/applications/rasp].

The tagger algorithm and feature set research was supported by the projects
//MSM0021620838// and //LC536// of Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports of the Czech Republic,
//GA405/09/0278// of the Grant Agency of the Czech Republic and //1ET101120503// of
Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic. The research was performed by
Drahomíra "johanka" Spoustová, Jan Hajič, Jan Raab and Miroslav Spousta.

=== English Morphologic System ===[english_morphologic_system]

The English morphology uses standard Penn Treebank POS tags. Nevertheless,
the lemma structure is unique:
- The lemmatizer recognizes negative prefixes and removes it from the lemma.
  In terms of MorphoDiTa API, //raw lemma// is the lemma without negative prefix.
- The negative prefix is also stored to allow morphologic generation of word
  form with the same negative prefix. In terms of MorphoDiTa API, //lemma id//
  is the raw lemma plus the negative prefix.


The negative prefix is separated from the (always nonempty) lemma using a ``^``
character (``able^un``). During morphologic generation, the negative prefix is honored.
Furthermore, when the lemma ends with ``^`` (i.e., negative prefix is empty, as
in ``able^``), forms with negative prefixes are generated. It is also possible
to generate all forms without any negative prefix by appending ``+`` after the lemma
(for example ``able+``).


=== English Model ===

The English model contains the following files:

: ``english-pdt-<version>.dict``
  Morphologic dictionary. The SCOWL word list has been automatically analyzed
  and lemmatized and uses as the dictionary. The guesser performing the analyzation
  and lemmatization is available.

: ``english-pdt-<version>.tagger``
  Tagger trained on the training portion of Wall Street Journal (Sections 0-18)
  and tuned on the development portion (Sections 19-21). Contains the
  ``english-pdt-<version>.dict`` morphologic dictionary.

  The latest version ``english-pdt-140304.tagger`` reaches 97.27% tag
  accuracy on Wall Street Journal test portion (Section 22-24). Model speed: ~60k words/s,
  model size: 6MB.


=== No Negations Variant ===

Stripping of negative prefixes (or handling the lemmas with negative prefixes
stripped) may not be desirable. Therefore, a variant of the English model
denoted by ``no_negation`` is provided, which does not strip negative prefixes
from lemmas.

: ``english-pdt-<version>-no_negation.dict``
  Morphologic dictionary which does not strip negative lemma prefixes. The
  SCOWL word list has been automatically analyzed and lemmatized and uses as
  the dictionary. The guesser performing the analyzation and lemmatization is
  available.

: ``english-pdt-<version>-no_negation.tagger``
  Tagger which does not strip negative lemma prefixes, trained on the training
  portion of Wall Street Journal (Sections 0-18) and tuned on the development
  portion (Sections 19-21). Contains the
  ``english-pdt-<version>-no_negation.dict`` morphologic dictionary.

  The latest version ``english-pdt-140304-no_negation.tagger`` reaches 97.25%
  tag accuracy on Wall Street Journal test portion (Section 22-24). Model
  speed: ~60k words/s, model size: 6MB.
