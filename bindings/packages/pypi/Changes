Revision history for ufal.morphodita

1.11.2.1 [15 Nov 23]
         Update MorphoDiTa to version 1.11.2.
         Fix a bug in the tokenizers, which did not end a sentence on an
           empty line if the preceding line ended with whitespace. However,
           only the REST server and the API was affected; the `run_*` binaries
           read input a paragraph at a time, and so circumvent the problem.
         Fix warnings in Clang 15 by qualifying `std::move`.
