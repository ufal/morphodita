MorphoDiTa User's Manual
========================

In a natural language text, the task of morphological analysis is to assign for
each token (word) in a sentence its lemma (cannonical form) and a part-of-speech
tag (POS tag). This is usually achieved in two steps: a morphological dictionary
looks up all possible lemmas and POS tags for each word, and subsequently, a
morphological tagger picks for each word the best lemma-POS tag candidate. The
second task is called a disambiguation.

MorphoDiTa also performs these two steps of morphological analysis: It first
outputs all possible pairs of lemma and POS tag for each token. Consequently,
the optimal combination of lemmas and POS tags is selected for the words in a
sentence using an algorithm described in Spoustová et al. 2009
(http://aclweb.org/anthology//E/E09/E09-1087.pdf).

Like any supervised machine learning tool, MorphoDiTa needs a trained linguistic
model. This section describes the available language models and also the
commandline tools and interfaces. The C++ library is described elsewhere, either
in MorphoDiTa API Tutorial or in MorphoDiTa API Reference.


Czech MorphoDiTa Models
-----------------------

Czech models are distributed under the CC BY-NC-SA
(http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/) licence. The Czech
morphology uses the MorfFlex CZ 160310 (http://hdl.handle.net/11234/1-1673)
Czech morphological dictionary and the Czech tagger is trained on PDT 3.0
(http://ufal.mff.cuni.cz/pdt3.0). Czech models work in MorphoDiTa version 1.0 or
later.

Apart from MorfFlex CZ dictionary, a prefix guesser and statistical guesser are
implemented and can be optionally used when performing morphological analysis.
The version 160310 cotains also models with DeriNet
(http://ufal.mff.cuni.cz/derinet) as a morphological derivator (requiring
MorphoDiTa 1.9 or later).

Czech models are versioned according to the version of the MorfFlex CZ
morphological dictionary used, the version format is YYMMDD, where YY, MM and DD
are two-digit representation of year, month and day, respectively. The latest
version is 160310.

Compared to Featurama http://sourceforge.net/projects/featurama/
(state-of-the-art Czech tagger implementation), the models are 5 times faster
and 10 times smaller.

Czech Morphological System
--------------------------

In the Czech language, MorphoDiTa uses Czech morphological system by Jan Hajič
(Hajič 2004 (http://books.google.cz/books?id=sB63AAAACAAJ)). In this system,
which we call PDT tag set, the tags are positional with 15 positions
corresponding to part of speech, detailed part of speech, gender, number, case,
etc. (e.g. NNFS1-----A----).  Different meanings of same lemmas are
distinguished and additional comments can be provided for every lemma meaning.
The lemma itself without the comments and meaning specification is called a raw
lemma. The following examples illustrate this:

- Japonsko_;G (raw lemma: Japonsko)
- se_^(zvr._zájmeno/částice) (raw lemma: se)
- tvořit_:T (raw lemma: tvořit)

For a more detailed reference about the Czech morphology, please see Lemma and
Tag Structure in PDT 2.0
(http://ufal.mff.cuni.cz/pdt2.0/doc/manuals/en/m-layer/html/ch02.html).


Main Czech Model
----------------

The main Czech model contains the following files:

czech-morfflex-160310.dict
  Morphological dictionary based on the Jan Hajič's (Hajič 2004
  (http://books.google.cz/books?id=sB63AAAACAAJ)) system with PDT tag set
  created from MorfFlex CZ 160310 (http://hdl.handle.net/11234/1-1674)
  morphological dictionary.

czech-morfflex-pdt-160310.tagger
  Tagger trained on the training portion of PDT 3.0
  (http://ufal.mff.cuni.cz/pdt3.0) using the neopren feature set. It contains
  the czech-morfflex-160310.dict morphological dictionary. and reaches 95.57%
  tag accuracy, 97.75% lemma accuracy and 94.93% overall accuracy on PDT 3.0
  (http://ufal.mff.cuni.cz/pdt3.0) etest data (whose morphological tags and
  lemmas were remapped using the czech-morfflex-160310.dict dictionary). Model
  speed: ~10k words/s, model size: 17MB.


Part of Speech Only Variant
---------------------------

The PDT tag set used by the main Czech model is very fine-grained. In many
situations, only the part of speech tags would be sufficient. Therefore, we
provide a variant of the model, denoted as pos_only, where only the first two
characters of the fifteen-letter tags are used, representing the part of speech
and detailed part of speech, respectively. There are 67 such two-letter tags.

czech-morfflex-160310-pos_only.dict
  Morphological dictionary based on the Jan Hajič's (Hajič 2004
  (http://books.google.cz/books?id=sB63AAAACAAJ)) system created from MorfFlex
  CZ 160310 (http://hdl.handle.net/11234/1-1674) morphological dictionary. Only
  first two tag characters of PDT tag set are used.

czech-morfflex-pdt-160310-pos_only.tagger
  Very fast tagger trained on the training portion of PDT 3.0
  (http://ufal.mff.cuni.cz/pdt3.0) using the neopren feature set. It contains
  the czech-morfflex-160310-pos_only.dict morphological dictionary and reaches
  99.04% tag accuracy, 97.62% lemma accuracy and 97.56% overall accuracy on PDT
  3.0 (http://ufal.mff.cuni.cz/pdt3.0) etest data (which morphological tags and
  lemmas were remapped using the czech-morfflex-160310-pos_only.dict
  dictionary). Model speed: ~200k words/s, model size: 4MB.


No Diacritical Marks Variant
----------------------------

Sometimes the text to be analyzed does not contain diacritical marks. We
therefore provide variants of the morphological dictionary and tagger for this
purpose - morphological analysis, morphological generation and tagging employ
forms without diacritical marks. Note that the lemmas do have diacritical marks.

We provide the no_dia variants for all four models described above:

czech-morfflex-160310-no_dia.dict
  No diacritical marks variant of czech-morfflex-160310.dict.

czech-morfflex-pdt-160310-no_dia.tagger
  No diacritical marks variant of czech-morfflex-160310.tagger. It reaches
  94.74% tag accuracy, 97.05% lemma accuracy and 93.83% overall accuracy on PDT
  3.0 (http://ufal.mff.cuni.cz/pdt3.0) etest data (which morphological tags and
  lemmas were remapped using the czech-morfflex-160310-no_dia.dict dictionary)
  with diacritical marks removed. Model speed: ~5k words/s, model size: 21MB.

czech-morfflex-160310-no_dia-pos_only.dict
  No diacritical marks variant of czech-morfflex-160310-pos_only.dict.

czech-morfflex-pdt-160310-no_dia-pos_only.tagger
  No diacritical marks variant of czech-morfflex-160310-pos_only.tagger. It
  reaches 98.59% tag accuracy, 97.04% lemma accuracy and 96.96% overall accuracy
  on PDT 3.0 (http://ufal.mff.cuni.cz/pdt3.0) etest data (which morphological
  tags and lemmas were remapped using the
  czech-morfflex-160310-no_dia-pos_only.dict dictionary) with diacritical marks
  removed. Model speed: ~130k words/s, model size: 9MB.


Morphological Derivation Model using DeriNet
--------------------------------------------

All version 160310 models are available also with morphological derivator using
DeriNet (http://ufal.mff.cuni.cz/derinet) version 1.1. The models which include
DeriNet require MorphoDiTa 1.9 or later.

In the future, only the models with DeriNet will be released.


Models with Raw Lemmas
----------------------

The Czech morphological system distinguish different meanings of same lemmas by
numbering the lemmas with multiple meanings and supplying additional comments
for every lemma meaning, as described and demonstrated in Czech Morphological
System. Sometimes this may be undesirable, for example when comparing to systems
which do not use the MorfFlex CZ 160310 (http://hdl.handle.net/11234/1-1674)
morphological dictionary.

To obtain lemmas without any additional information (raw lemmas in terms of
MorphoDiTa API), use strip_lemma_id tag set converter.  Previously, specific
dictionary and tagger model variants were provided, which is not needed anymore.

English Morphological System
----------------------------

The English morphology uses standard Penn Treebank POS tags. Nevertheless, the
lemma structure is unique:
- The lemmatizer recognizes negative prefixes and removes it from the lemma. In
  terms of MorphoDiTa API, raw lemma is the lemma without negative prefix.
- The negative prefix is also stored to allow morphological generation of word
  form with the same negative prefix. In terms of MorphoDiTa API, lemma id is
  the raw lemma plus the negative prefix.

The negative prefix is separated from the (always nonempty) lemma using a ^
character (able^un). During morphological generation, the negative prefix is
honored. Furthermore, when the lemma ends with ^ (i.e., negative prefix is
empty, as in able^), forms with negative prefixes are generated. It is also
possible to generate all forms without any negative prefix by appending + after
the lemma (for example able+).


English Model
-------------

The English model contains the following files:

english-morphium-<version>.dict
  Morphological dictionary. The SCOWL word list has been automatically analyzed
  and lemmatized and uses as the dictionary. The guesser performing the
  analyzation and lemmatization is available.

english-morphium-wsj-<version>.tagger
  Tagger trained on the training portion of Wall Street Journal (Sections 0-18)
  and tuned on the development portion (Sections 19-21). Contains the
  english-morphium-<version>.dict morphological dictionary.

  The latest version english-morphium-wsj-140407.tagger reaches 97.27% tag
  accuracy on Wall Street Journal test portion (Section 22-24). Model speed:
  ~60k words/s, model size: 6MB.


No Negations Variant
--------------------

Stripping of negative prefixes (or handling the lemmas with negative prefixes
stripped) may not be desirable. Therefore, a variant of the English model
denoted by no_negation is provided, which does not strip negative prefixes from
lemmas.

english-morphium-<version>-no_negation.dict
  Morphological dictionary which does not strip negative lemma prefixes. The
  SCOWL word list has been automatically analyzed and lemmatized and uses as the
  dictionary. The guesser performing the analyzation and lemmatization is
  available.

english-morphium-wsj-<version>-no_negation.tagger
  Tagger which does not strip negative lemma prefixes, trained on the training
  portion of Wall Street Journal (Sections 0-18) and tuned on the development
  portion (Sections 19-21). Contains the
  english-morphium-<version>-no_negation.dict morphological dictionary.

  The latest version english-morphium-wsj-140407-no_negation.tagger reaches
  97.25% tag accuracy on Wall Street Journal test portion (Section 22-24). Model
  speed: ~60k words/s, model size: 6MB.


English Model Changes
---------------------

english-morphium-140407 and english-morphium-wsj-140407 (require MorphoDiTa 1.1 or later)
  Recognize also "non-" as a negative prefix. Formerly, only "non" was
  recognized.

english-morphium-140304 and english-morphium-wsj-140304 (require MorphoDiTa 1.0 or later)
  Initial release.


Running the Tagger
------------------

Probably the most common usage of MorphoDita is running a tagger to tag your
data using
  run_tagger tagger_model

The input is assumed to be in UTF-8 encoding and can be either already tokenized
and segmented, or it can be a plain text which is tokenized and segmented
automatically.

Any number of files can be specified after the tagger_model. If an argument
input_file:output_file is used, the given input_file is processed and the result
is saved to output_file. If only input_file is used, the result is saved to
standard output. If no argument is given, input is read from standard input and
written to standard output.

The full command syntax of run_tagger is
  run_tagger [options] tagger_file [file[:output_file]]...
  Options: --input=untokenized|vertical
           --convert_tagset=pdt_to_conll2009|strip_lemma_comment|strip_lemma_id
           --derivation=none|root|path|tree
           --guesser=0|1 (should morphological guesser be used)
           --output=vertical|xml


Input Formats
-------------

The input format is specified using the --input option. Currently supported
input formats are:
- untokenized (default): the input is tokenized and segmented using a tokenizer
  defined by the model,
- vertical: the input is in vertical format, every line is considered a word,
  with empty line denoting end of sentence.


Tag Set Conversion
------------------

Some tag sets can be converted to different ones. Currently supported tag set
conversions are:
- pdt_to_conll2009: convert Czech PDT tag set to CoNLL 2009 tag set,
- strip_lemma_comment: strip lemma comment (see Lemma Structure in API
  Reference),
- strip_lemma_id: strip lemma id (see Lemma Structure in API Reference).


Morphological Derivation
------------------------

If the morphological model includes a morphological derivator, some
morphological derivation operation may be performed on lemmas:
- none (default): no morphological derivation is performed
- root: lemma is replaced by its root in the morphological derivation tree
- path: lemma is replaced by a space separated path to its root in the
  morphological derivation tree (the original lemma is first, followed by its
  parent, with the root being the last one)
- tree: whole morphological derivation tree is appended after the lemma,
  encoded in the following way: root node is the first, then the subtrees of the
  root children are encoded recursively (each after one space), followed by a
  final space (which denotes that the children are complete)


Morphological Guesser
---------------------

By default, every tagger model uses the morphological guesser settings employed
during the model training. However, the usage of morphological guesser can be
overridden by the guesser parameter.


Output Formats
--------------

The output format is specified using the --output option. Currently supported
output formats are:
- xml (default): Simple XML format without a root element, using <sentence>
  element to mark sentences and <token lemma="..." tag="...">...</token> element
  to encode token and its assigned lemma and tag.

  Example output for input Děti pojedou k babičce. Už se těší. (line
  breaks added):
  <sentence><token lemma='dítě' tag='NNFP1-----A----'>Děti</token>
  <token lemma='jet-1_^(pohybovat_se,_ne_však_chůzí)' tag='VB-P---3F-AA---'>pojedou</token>
  <token lemma='k-1' tag='RR--3----------'>k</token>
  <token lemma='babička' tag='NNFS3-----A----'>babičce</token>
  <token lemma='.' tag='Z:-------------'>.</token></sentence>
  <sentence><token lemma='už-1' tag='Db-------------'>Už</token>
  <token lemma='se_^(zvr._zájmeno/částice)' tag='P7-X4----------'>se</token>
  <token lemma='těšit_:T' tag='VB-S---3P-AA---'>těší</token>
  <token lemma='.' tag='Z:-------------'>.</token></sentence>


- vertical: Every output line is a tag separated triple form-lemma-tag, with
  empty line denoting end of sentence.

  Example output for input Děti pojedou k babičce. Už se těší.:
  Děti	dítě	NNFP1-----A----
  pojedou	jet-1_^(pohybovat_se,_ne_však_chůzí)	VB-P---3F-AA---

Running the Morphology
----------------------

There are multiple commands performing morphological tasks. The
run_morpho_analyze executable performs morphological analysis and the
run_morpho_generate executable performs morphological generation. The output of
these commands is suitable for automatic processing.

The run_morpho_cli executable performs both morphological analysis and
generation, but is designed to be used interactively and produces more
human-readable output.


Morphological Analysis
----------------------

The morphological analysis can be performed by running
  run_morpho_analyze morphology_model use_guesser

The input is assumed to be in UTF-8 encoding and can be either already tokenized
and segmented, or it can be a plain text which is tokenized and segmented
automatically. The input files are specified same as with the run_tagger
command.

Some morphological models contain both a manually created dictionary and a
guesser. Therefore, a numeric use_guesser argument is required. If non-zero, the
guesser is used, otherwise not.

Because tagger models contain an embedded morphological model, a tagger model
can be used instead of morphological one if --from_tagger option is specified.

The full command syntax of run_morpho_analyze is
  run_morpho_analyze [options] morphology_model use_guesser [file[:output_file]]...
  Options: --input=untokenized|vertical
           --convert_tagset=pdt_to_conll2009|strip_lemma_comment|strip_lemma_id
           --derivation=none|root|path|tree
           --output=vertical|xml
           --from_tagger


Input Formats
-------------

The input format is specified using the --input option. Currently supported
input formats are:
- untokenized (default): the input is tokenized and segmented using a tokenizer
  defined by the model,
- vertical: the input is in vertical format, every line is considered a word,
  with empty line denoting end of sentence.

Note that the input data is also segmented, even if it is not strictly
necessary. Therefore, the input is processed by whole paragraphs (ending by an
empty line).


Tag Set Conversion
------------------

Some tag sets can be converted to different ones. Currently supported tag set
conversions are:
- pdt_to_conll2009: convert Czech PDT tag set to CoNLL 2009 tag set,
- strip_lemma_comment: strip lemma comment (see Lemma Structure in API
  Reference),
- strip_lemma_id: strip lemma id (see Lemma Structure in API Reference).


Morphological Derivation
------------------------

If the morphological model includes a morphological derivator, some
morphological derivation operation may be performed on lemmas:
- none (default): no morphological derivation is performed
- root: lemma is replaced by its root in the morphological derivation tree
- path: lemma is replaced by a space separated path to its root in the
  morphological derivation tree (the original lemma is first, followed by its
  parent, with the root being the last one)
- tree: whole morphological derivation tree is appended after the lemma,
  encoded in the following way: root node is the first, then the subtrees of the
  root children are encoded recursively (each after one space), followed by a
  final space (which denotes that the children are complete)


Output Formats
--------------

The output format is specified using the --output option. Currently supported
output formats are:
- xml (default): Simple XML format without a root element, using using
  <token><analysis lemma="..." tag="..."/><analysis...>...</token> element to
  encode morphological analysis.

  Example output for input Děti pojedou k babičce. Už se těší. (line
  breaks added):
  <sentence><token><analysis lemma="dítě" tag="NNFP1-----A----"/><analysis lemma="dítě" tag="NNFP4-----A----"/><analysis lemma="dítě" tag="NNFP5-----A----"/>Děti</token>

- vertical: Every output line contains a word and a tab separated lemma-tag
  pairs assigned to the input word, with empty line denoting end of sentence.

Morphological Generation
------------------------

The morphological generation can be performed by running
  run_morpho_generate morphology_model use_guesser

The input is assumed to be in UTF-8 encoding. The input files are specified same
as with the run_tagger command.

Input for morphological generation has to be in vertical format, each line
containing a lemma, which can be optionally followed by a tab and a tag
wildcard. The output has the same number of lines as input, line l contains tab
separated form-lemma-tag triplets which can be generated from the lemma on he
input line l. If a tag wildcard was provided, only triplets with matching tags
are returned.

Some morphological models contain both a manually created dictionary and a
guesser. Therefore, a numeric use_guesser argument is required. If non-zero, the
guesser is used, otherwise not.

Because tagger models contain an embedded morphological model, a tagger model
can be used instead of morphological one if --from_tagger option is specified.

The full command syntax of run_morpho_generate is
  run_morpho_generate [options] morphology_model use_guesser [input_file[:output_file]]...
  Options: --convert_tagset=pdt_to_conll2009|strip_lemma_comment|strip_lemma_id
           --from_tagger

Example input data:
  dítě

  babička	NNFS3-----A----

Example output:

Tag Set Conversion
------------------

Some tag sets can be converted to different ones. Currently supported tag set
conversions are:
- pdt_to_conll2009: convert Czech PDT tag set to CoNLL 2009 tag set,
- strip_lemma_comment: strip lemma comment (see Lemma Structure in API
  Reference),
- strip_lemma_id: strip lemma id (see Lemma Structure in API Reference).

Note that the tag set conversion is applied only to the output, not to the input
lemmas and wildcards.


Tag Wildcards
-------------

When only forms with a specific tag should be generated for a given lemma, tag
wildcard can be specified. The tag wildcard is a simple wildcard allowing to
filter the results of morphological generation.

Most characters of a tag wildcard match corresponding characters of a tag, with
the following exceptions:
 - ? matches any character of a tag.
 - [chars] matches any of the characters listed. The dash - has no special
   meaning and if ] is the first character in chars, it is considered as one of
   the characters and does not end the group.
 - [^chars] matches any of the characters not listed.


Interactive Morphological Analysis and Generation
-------------------------------------------------

Morphological analysis and generation which is interactive and more human
readable can be run using:
  run_morpho_cli morphology_model

The input is read from standard input, command on each line. If there is no tab
on a line, analysis is performed on the given word. If there is a tab on a line,
generation is performed on the first word, using the second word as a tag
wildcard.  If the second word is empty (i.e., the input is for example ``on	``),
all forms are generated.

Because tagger models contain an embedded morphological model, a tagger model
can be used instead of morphological one if --from_tagger option is specified.

The full command syntax of run_morpho_cli is
  run_morpho_cli [options] morphology_model
  Options: --from_tagger


Running the Tokenizer
---------------------

Using the run_tokenizer executable it is possible to perform only tokenization
and segmentation.

The input is a UTF-8 encoded plain text and the input files are specified same
as with the run_tagger command.

The tokenizer can be specified either by using a morphology model (--morphology
option), tagger model (--tagger option) or by using a tokenizer identifier
(--tokenizer option). Currently supported tokenizer identifiers are:
- czech
- english
- generic

The full command syntax of run_tokenizer is
  run_tokenizer [options] [file[:output_file]]...
  Options: --tokenizer=czech|english|generic
           --morphology=morphology_model_file
           --tagger=tagger_model_file
           --output=vertical|xml


Output Formats
--------------

The output format is specified using the --output option. Currently supported
output formats are:
- xml (default): Simple XML format without a root element, using <sentence>
  element to mark sentences and <token> element to mark tokens.

  Example output for input Děti pojedou k babičce. Už se těší. (line
  breaks added):
  <sentence><token>Děti</token> <token>pojedou</token> <token>k</token>
  <token>babičce</token><token>.</token></sentence> <sentence><token>Už</token>
  <token>se</token> <token>těší</token><token>.</token></sentence>


- vertical: Each token is on a separate line, every sentence is ended by a
  blank line.

  Example output for input Děti pojedou k babičce. Už se těší.:
  Děti
  pojedou
  k
  babičce
  .

  Už
  se
  těší
  .




Running REST Server
-------------------

MorphoDiTa also provides REST server binary morphodita_server. The binary uses
MicroRestD (http://github.com/ufal/microrestd) as a REST server implementation
and provides MorphoDiTa REST API
(http://lindat.mff.cuni.cz/services/morphodita/api-reference.php).

The full command syntax of morphodita_server is
  morphodita_server [options] port (model_name weblicht_id model_file acknowledgements)*
  Options: --daemon

The morphodita_server can run either in foreground or in background (when
--daemon is used). The specified model files are loaded during start and kept in
memory all the time. This behaviour might change in future to load the models on
demand.


Custom Morphological and Tagging Models
---------------------------------------

It is possible to create custom morphological and tagging models.


Custom Morphological Models
---------------------------

Custom morphological models can be created using encode_dictionary binary.

The encode_dictionary reads from standard input and prints MorphoDiTa
morphological model on standard output.  The input of encode_dictionary is a
textual representation of morphological dictionary. It should be UTF-8 encoded
and every line should be a tab separated triplet lemma \t tag \t form. All forms
of one lemma must appear in a continuous region and no line should appear more
than once (sort -u can be used to achieve this).

Run encode_dictionary with the following options:
  encode_dictionary generic max_suffix_len unknown_tag number_tag punctuation_tag symbol_tag

- generic: This parameter defines tokenizer and other language specific
  behaviour. Other values than generic take different options and are not
  documented.

- max_suffix_len: Maximum length of suffixes in automatically inferred
  inflexion classes.  If unsure, use 8 (we use 8 for Czech and 4 for English).
  Smaller values produce larger and slightly faster models.

- unknown_tag: Assigned to a form during analysis if no matching tag can be
  found.

- number_tag: Assigned to a form during analysis if the form was not found in
  the dictionary and it looks like a number. Can be the same as unknown_tag.

- punctuation_tag: Assigned to a form during analysis if the form was not found
  in the dictionary and it consists of Unicode characters in the Punctuation
  category. Can be the same as unknown_tag.

- symbol_tag: Assigned to a form during analysis if the form was not found in
  the dictionary and it consists of Unicode characters in the Symbol category.
  Can be the same as unknown_tag.

Example input data:
  dog	NN	dog
  dog	NNS	dogs
  go	VB	go
  go	VBP	go
  go	VBZ	goes
  go	VBG	going
  go	VBD	went

Example command line:
  encode_dictionary generic 8 UNK NUM PUNC SYM <input_data >output_model


Using External Morphology
-------------------------

Sometimes it is useful to train MorphoDiTa tagger using external morphological
analysis, without having a MorphoDiTa morphological dictionary.

That is possible using a so called external morphology model. External
morphology model can be created easily using
  encode_dictionary external unknown_tag >output_model

No standard input is read in this case. The unknown_tag parameter is used when
no tag is assigned to a word form during analysis. The resulting model is
printed on standard output.

The external morphology model does not contain any morphological dictionary.
Instead, it expects the user to perform morphological analysis and generation on
their own. Therefore, the input form to analysis is expected to be followed by
space separated lemma-tag pairs, which are returned by the analysis. Similarly,
the input lemma to generation is expected to be followed by space separated
form-tag pairs, which are again returned by the generation (possibly filtered by
a tag wildcard). (To extract the length of the form or lemma itself even when
followed by external analyses, API calls raw_form_len or raw_lemma_len and
lemma_id_len can be used.)

Note that the tokenizer returned by the external morphology model is the same as
the tokenizer of the generic model, and splits input on spaces. Therefore, it
can be used to tokenize input, the tokens then passed to the external
morphology, and the results can be after proper formatting used as input to
MorphoDiTa in vertical input format.

Example input form for analysis using external morphology model:
  wishes wish NNS wish VBZ

Example input lemma for generation using external morphology model:
  go go VB go VBP goes VBZ going VBG went VBG


Custom Tagging Models
---------------------

Custom tagging models can be trained using train_tagger binary, which has the
following options:
  train_tagger generic_234 morphology use_guesser features iterations prune_features [heldout_data [early_stopping]] <input_data >tagger_model

- generic_234: This parameter defines the tagger (elementary features and
  algorithm) and the order of Viterbi decoding. Use either generic2, generic3 or
  generic4. If unsure, use generic3 (best released Czech and English models use
  generic3). The generic2 produces faster, but less accurate models, generic4
  produces larger and only marginally better models.

- morphology: File with the morphological dictionary to use.

- use_guesser: Use 0/1 to specify whether morphological guesser should be used.
  Unless you have a good reason not to, use 1.

- features: File with feature sequences for the tagger. The file format and
  available elementary features are described in following section.

- iterations: Number of training iterations. For English, values 5-10 are used,
  for Czech, values 10-15 are used. Can be affected by early_stopping.

- prune_features: Use 0/1 to disable/enable pruning of feature sequences not
  found in training data. Use 1 for smaller and marginally less accurate models,
  and 0 for larger and marginally better models. If unsure, use 1 (best released
  Czech and English models use 1).

- heldout_data: Optional file with heldout data in the same format as input
  data.  If supplied, accuracy is measured on the heldout data after every
  training iteration.

- early_stopping: Optionally use 0/1 to disable/enable early stopping. If early
  stopping is enabled, the resulting model is not the one after the last
  training iteration, but the one with best heldout data accuracy.

Example command line (use morphology from morpho.dict, features from features.ft
and no heldout data):
  train_tagger generic3 morpho.dict 1 features.ft 10 1 <input.data >tagger.model

Example command line (use morphology from morpho.dict, features from features.ft
and use heldout data with early stopping):
  train_tagger generic3 morpho.dict 1 features.ft 15 1 heldout.data 1 <input.data >tagger.model

See next sections for examples of input data and feature files.


Input Data Format
-----------------

The input data (and the heldout data) represent a sequence of sentences.
Different sentences do not interact in any way. Words of one sentence are stored
on consecutive lines, each line containing tab separated triplet form \t lemma
\t tag in UTF-8 encoding. End of sentence is denoted by an empty line.

Example:
  Děti	dítě	NNFP1-----A----
  pojedou	jet-1_^(pohybovat_se,_ne_však_chůzí)	VB-P---3F-AA---
  k	k-1	RR--3----------
  babičce	babička	NNFS3-----A----
  .	.	Z:-------------

  Už	už-1	Db-------------
  se	se_^(zvr._zájmeno/částice)	P7-X4----------
  těší	těšit_:T	VB-S---3P-AA---
  .	.	Z:-------------


Feature File Format
-------------------

The features used in the tagger have major influence on tagging performance. The
feature file contains several feature sequences, each sequence consisting of
several elementary features. The elementary features are computed by MorphoDiTa
and different tagger models can have a different set of elementary features.
Here we describe elementary features of generic tagger:
- Form: word form
- Prefix1 .. Prefix9: word form prefix of length 1..9 (measured in Unicode
  characters)
- Suffix1 .. Suffix9: word form suffix of length 1..9 (measured in Unicode
  characters)
- Num: whether the word form contains at least one numbers (Unicode category
  Number)
- Cap: whether the word form contains at least one uppercase or titlecase
  letter
- Dash: whether the word form contains at least one dash (Unicode category
  'Punctuation, Dash')
- Tag: word form PoS tag
- Tag1 .. Tag5: letter 1..5 of word form PoS tag
- Lemma: word form lemma
- FollowingVerbTag: PoS tag of a nearest following verb, i.e., a nearest
  following word form with at least one of the PoS tags starting with V
- FollowingVerbLemma: lemma of a nearest following verb, i.e., a nearest
  following word form with at least one of the PoS tags starting with V
- PreviousVerbTag: PoS tag of a nearest previous verb, i.e., a nearest previous
  word whose PoS tag (assigned by the tagger) starts with V
- PreviousVerbTag: lemma of a nearest previous verb, i.e., a nearest previous
  word whose PoS tag (assigned by the tagger) starts with V

The feature file defines feature sequences which can be applied to a word form.
A feature sequence consists of elementary features assigned to the given form or
its neighbours.

Every line in the feature file defines one feature sequence. A feature sequence
consists of comma joined space separated pairs of elementary feature and an
offset to which does the elementary feature apply (i.e., Form 0 or Tag 0,Lemma
-1). The file format is strict and does not allow any additional spaces or
commas.

Note that offset of some of the elementary features is affected by the order or
Viterbi decoding used. Notably, if Viterbi decoding of order N is utilized, Tag
and Lemma can be used inside the decoded window, i.e., only with offsets -N+1 ..
0.

For inspiration, we present feature files used for releases Czech and English

Measuring Tagger Accuracy
-------------------------

Measuring custom tagger accuracy can be performed by running:
  tagger_accuracy tagger_model <test_data

This binary reads input in the same format as train_tagger, i.e., tab separated
form-lemma-tag triplets, and evaluates the accuracy of the tagger model on the
given testing data.


MorphoDiTa API Tutorial
=======================

The MorphoDiTa API is defined in header morphodita.h and resides in
ufal::morphodita namespace. The easiest way to use MorphoDita is therefore:

  #include morphodita.h

  using namespace ufal::morphodita;


Tagger API
----------

The main access to MorphoDiTa tagger is through class tagger.  An example of
this class usage can be found in program file run_tagger.cpp. A typical tagger
usage may look like this:

  #include tagger/tagger.h;

  using namespace ufal::morphodita;

  //...

  // load model to memory and construct tagger
  tagger* my_tagger = tagger::load("path_to_model");

  if (!t) ...

  // create sample input
  vector<string> words;
  words.push_back("malý");
  words.push_back("pes");

  vector<string_piece> forms;
  for (auto& word : words)
    forms.emplace_back(word)

  // intialize output and tag
  vector<tagged_lemma> tags;
  my_tagger->tag(forms, tags);

  // access the output
  for (auto& tag : tags)
    printf("%s\t%s\n", tag.lemma.c_str(), tag.tag.c_str());

  delete my_tagger;

The tagger is constructed by an overloaded factory method with one argument. The
constructor either accepts an input stream (istream&) with the model or a C
string (const char*) with a file name of the model. The constructor loads the
linguistic model to memory and returns the tagger pointer ready for tagging,
returning NULL if unsuccessful. If an input stream is used, it is positioned
right after the end of the model.

The main tagging method is tagger::tag:

  void tag(const std::vector<string_piece>& forms, std::vector<tagged_lemma>& tags) const;

The input is a std::vector of string_piece which is a structure referencing a
string using const char* str and size_t len.

The tagger::tag method returns the tagged output in it's second argument,
std::vector<tagged_lemma>. The calling procedure must provide a result vector
and the tagger assigns the output to this vector. Obviously, the indexes in the
output vector correspond to indexes in input vector.  tagged_lemma has two
public members: std::string lemma and std:string tag, corresponding to predicted
lemma and tag, respectively.


Morphological Dictionary API
----------------------------

The main access to MorphoDiTa morphological dictionary is through class morpho.
An example of this interface usage can be found in a program file
run_morpho.cpp.


Dictionary Construction
-----------------------

Similarly to the tagger, MorphoDiTa morphological dictionary is constructed by
an overloaded factory method which accepts either an input stream (istream&) or
a C string const char* with the file name of the dictionary. The factory method
returns a pointer to morphological dictionary or NULL if unsuccessful.

  #include morpho/morpho.h

  using namespace ufal::morphodita;

  //...

  // load dictionary to memory
  morpho* my_morpho = morpho::load("path_to_dictionary");

  //...

  delete(my_morpho);

Another way of obtaining a pointer to morphology dictionary is through an
instance of tagger class - every tagger has a morphology dictionary, which is
available through the method

  virtual const morpho* get_morpho() const = 0;

Please note that you should not delete this pointer as it is owned by the tagger
class instance.


Morphological Analysis
----------------------

MorphoDiTa morphological dictionary offers two functionalities: It either
analyzes the given word, that means it outputs all possible lemma-tag pairs
candidates for the given form; or for a given lemma-tag pair, it generates a
form or a whole list of possible forms.

In the first case, one performs morphological analysis for a given word by
calling a method morpho::analyze:

  int analyze(string_piece form, guesser_mode guesser, std::vector<tagged_lemma>& lemmas) const;

An example (assuming that morphological dictionary is already constructed, see
previous example):

  vector<tagged_lemma> lemmas;    // output

  my_morpho->analyze("pes", morpho::GUESSER, vector<tagged_lemma>& lemmas);

  for (auto& lemma: lemmas)
    printf ("%s %s\n, lemma.lemma.c_str(), lemma.tag.c_str())

The input is a form to analyze, then a Guesser mode (whether to use some kind of
guesser or strictly dictionary only, see question Guesser Mode in Questions and
Answers) and output std::vector<tagged_lemma>.  The caller must provide an
output vector std::vector<tagged_lemma> and the method morpho::analyze assigns
the output to this vector.


Generation
----------

MorphoDiTa performs morphological generation from a given lemma:

  int generate(string_piece lemma, const char* tag_wildcard, guesser_mode guesser,
               std::vector<tagged_lemma_forms>& forms) const;


Tag Wildcard
------------

Optionally, a tag wildcard can be specified (or be NULL) and if so, results are
filtered using this wildcard. This method can be therefore used in more ways:
One may wish to generate all possible forms and their tags from a given lemma.
Then the tag_wildcard is set to NULL and the method generates all possible
combinations. One may also need a generate a specific form and tag from a given
lemma, then tag_wildcard is set to this tag value.

Or even more, for example, in the Czech positional morphology tagging system
(Hajič 2004 (http://books.google.cz/books?id=sB63AAAACAAJ)), one may even wish
to generate something like "all forms in fourth case", then tag_wildcard should
be set to ????4. Please see Section "Czech Morphology" in User's Manual for more
details about the Czech positional tagging system. The previous example applies
to morphological annotation of PDT (http://ufal.mff.cuni.cz/pdt3.0), however,
the tag wildcards can be used in any morphological tagging system.

Most characters of a tag wildcard match corresponding characters of a tag, with
the following exceptions:
 - ? matches any character of a tag.
 - [chars] matches any of the characters listed. The dash - has no special
   meaning and if ] is the first character in chars, it is considered as one of
   the characters and does not end the group.
 - [^chars] matches any of the characters not listed.


Unknown Lemmas
--------------

When the lemma is unknown, MorphoDiTa's generation behavior is defined by
Guesser mode (see also question Guesser Mode in Questions and Answers). If at
least one lemma is found in the dictionary, NO_GUESSER is returned. If guesser
== GUESSER and the lemma is found by the guesser, GUESSER is returned.
Otherwise, forms are cleared and -1 is returned.


Questions and Answers
---------------------

What is a Guesser Mode?
  Morphological analysis may try to guess the lemma and tag of an uknown word.
  This option is turned on by morpho::GUESSER and off by morpho::NO_GUESSER.

Why `string_piece`` and not const char* or std::string?
  We aim to make MorphoDiTa interface as effective as possible. Because the
  input strings may be substrings of larger text or come from different than C++
  memory regions, we want to avoid the cost of \\0 padding or string conversion.
  Nevertheless, both const char* and std::string can be used instead of a
  string_piece because of existing implicit conversion rules.


MorphoDiTa API Reference
========================

The MorphoDiTa API is defined in header morphodita.h and resides in
ufal::morphodita namespace.

The strings used in the MorphoDiTa API are always UTF-8 encoded (except from
file paths, whose encoding is system dependent).


MorphoDiTa Versioning
---------------------

MorphoDiTa is versioned using Semantic Versioning (http://semver.org/).
Therefore, a version consists of three numbers major.minor.patch, optionally
followed by a hyphen and pre-release version info, with the following semantics:

- Stable versions have no pre-release version info, development have non-empty
  pre-release version info.
- Two versions with the same major.minor have the same API with the same
  behaviour, apart from bugs. Therefore, if only patch is increased, the new
  version is only a bug-fix release.
- If two versions v and u have the same major, but minor(v) is greater than
  minor(u), version v contains only additions to the API. In other words, the
  API of u is all present in v with the same behaviour (once again apart from
  bugs). It is therefore safe to upgrade to a newer MorphoDiTa version with the
  same major.
- If two versions differ in major, their API may differ in any way.

Models created by MorphoDiTa have the same behaviour in all MorphoDiTa versions
with same major, apart from obvious bugfixes. On the other hand, models created
from the same data by different major.minor MorphoDiTa versions may have
different behaviour.


Lemma Structure
---------------

The lemmas used by MorphoDiTa consist of three parts:

1. raw lemma: text form of the lemma. May not uniquely distinguish lemma
   meanings, lemma use cases etc.
2. lemma id: together with raw lemma provide a unique identifier of the lemma,
   possibly including lemma meanings or use cases.
3. lemma comments: additional comments for the given lemma.

These parts are stored in one string and the boundaries between them can be
determined by morpho::raw_lemma_len and morpho::lemma_id_len methods. Analyzer
and tagger always return lemma in this structured form. When performing
morphological generation, either raw lemma or both raw lemma and lemma id can be
specified, any lemma comments are ignored.


Struct string_piece
-------------------

  struct string_piece {
    const char* str;
    size_t len;

    string_piece();
    string_piece(const char* str);
    string_piece(const char* str, size_t len);
    string_piece(const std::string& str);
  }

The string_piece is used for efficient string passing. The string referenced in
string_piece is not owned by it, so users have to make sure the referenced
string exists as long as the string_piece.


Struct tagged_form
------------------

  struct tagged_form {
    std::string form;
    std::string tag;
  };

The tagged_form is a pair of strings used when obtaining a form and tag pair.


Struct tagged_lemma
-------------------

  struct tagged_lemma {
    std::string lemma;
    std::string tag;
  };

The tagged_lemma is a pair of strings used when obtaining a lemma and tag pair.


Struct tagged_lemma_forms
-------------------------

  struct tagged_lemma_forms {
    std::string lemma;
    std::vector<tagged_form> forms;
  };

The tagged_lemma_forms represents a lemma and a list of tagged forms.


Struct token_range
------------------

  struct token_range {
    size_t start;
    size_t length;
  };

The token_range represent a range of a token as returned by a tokenizer. The
start and length fields specify the token position in Unicode characters, not in
bytes of UTF-8 encoding.


Struct derivated_lemma
----------------------

  struct derivated_lemma {
    std::string lemma;
  };

The derivated_lemma structure stores information about a derivation. This
information currently consists of lemma only, but a type of the derivation may
be added later.


Class version
-------------

  class version {
   public:
    unsigned major;
    unsigned minor;
    unsigned patch;
    std::string prerelease;

    static version current();
  };

The version class represents MorphoDiTa version. See MorphoDiTa Versioning for
more information.


version::current
----------------

  static version current();

Returns current MorphoDiTa version.


Class tokenizer
---------------

  class tokenizer {
   public:
    virtual ~tokenizer() {}

    virtual void set_text(string_piece text, bool make_copy = false) = 0;
    virtual bool next_sentence(std::vector<string_piece>* forms, std::vector<token_range>* tokens) = 0;

    static tokenizer* new_vertical_tokenizer();
    static tokenizer* new_czech_tokenizer();
    static tokenizer* new_english_tokenizer();
    static tokenizer* new_generic_tokenizer();
  };

The tokenizer class performs segmentation and tokenization of given text. The
class is not threadsafe.

The tokenizer instances can be obtained either directly using static methods or
through instances of morpho and tagger.


tokenizer::set_text
-------------------

  virtual void set_text(string_piece text, bool make_copy = false) = 0;

Set the text which is to be tokenized.

If make_copy is false, only a reference to the given text is stored and the user
has to make sure it exists until the tokenizer is released or set_text is called
again. If make_copy is true, a copy of the given text is made and retained until
the tokenizer is released or set_text is called again.


tokenizer::next_sentence
------------------------

  virtual bool next_sentence(std::vector<string_piece>* forms, std::vector<token_range>* tokens) = 0;

Locate and return next sentence of the given text. Returns true when successful
and false when there are no more sentences in the given text. The arguments are
filled with found tokens if not NULL. The forms contain token ranges in bytes of
UTF-8 encoding, the tokens contain token ranges in Unicode characters.


tokenizer::new_vertical_tokenizer
---------------------------------

  static tokenizer new_vertical_tokenizer();

Returns a new instance of a vertical tokenizer, which considers every line to be
one token, with empty line denoting end of sentence. The user should delete the
instance after use.


tokenizer::new_czech_tokenizer
------------------------------

  static tokenizer new_czech_tokenizer();

Returns a new instance of a Czech tokenizer. The user should delete it after
use.

If two MorphoDiTa versions have the same major.minor, this tokenizer should
behave identically (apart from obvious bugfixes). Nevertheless, the behaviour of
this tokenizer might change in different major.minor version. If you need a
tokenizer whose behaviour does not change, use tokenizer embedded in a
morphological dictionary.


tokenizer::new_english_tokenizer
--------------------------------

  static tokenizer new_english_tokenizer();

Returns a new instance of a English tokenizer. The user should delete it after
use.

If two MorphoDiTa versions have the same major.minor, this tokenizer should
behave identically (apart from obvious bugfixes). Nevertheless, the behaviour of
this tokenizer might change in different major.minor version. If you need a
tokenizer whose behaviour does not change, use tokenizer embedded in a
morphological dictionary.


tokenizer::new_generic_tokenizer
--------------------------------

  static tokenizer new_generic_tokenizer();

Returns a new instance of a generic tokenizer. The user should delete it after
use.

If two MorphoDiTa versions have the same major.minor, this tokenizer should
behave identically (apart from obvious bugfixes). Nevertheless, the behaviour of
this tokenizer might change in different major.minor version. If you need a
tokenizer whose behaviour does not change, use tokenizer embedded in a
morphological dictionary.


Class derivator
---------------

  class derivator {
   public:
    virtual ~derivator();

    virtual bool parent(string_piece lemma, derivated_lemma& parent) const = 0;
    virtual bool children(string_piece lemma, std::vector<derivated_lemma>& children) const = 0;
  };

The derivator class perform morphological derivation on given lemmas. The
derivation are computed using lemma ids, see Lemma Structure.

The derivator instances can be obtained through instances of morpho (and
transitively through tagger).


derivator::parent
-----------------

  virtual bool parent(string_piece lemma, derivated_lemma& parent) const = 0;

Return the parent of a given lemma in the morphological derivation tree. The
lemma is assumed to be lemma id (see Lemma Structure), so if it contains any
lemma comments, they are ignored.

The returned lemma is a full lemma (lemma id plus appropriate lemma comments).

If no parent exists, the function empties the parent lemma and returns false.


derivator::children
-------------------

  virtual bool children(string_piece lemma, std::vector<derivated_lemma>& children) const = 0;

Return children of a given lemma in the morphological derivation tree. The lemma
is assumed to be lemma id (see Lemma Structure), so if it contains any lemma
comments, they are ignored.

The returned lemmas are full lemmas (lemma ids plus appropriate lemma comments).

If no children exist, the function empties the children vector and returns
false.


Class derivation_formatter
--------------------------

  class derivation_formatter {
   public:
    virtual ~derivation_formatter() {}

    virtual void format_derivation(std::string& lemma) const = 0;

    static derivation_formatter* new_none_derivation_formatter();
    static derivation_formatter* new_root_derivation_formatter(const derivator* derinet);
    static derivation_formatter* new_path_derivation_formatter(const derivator* derinet);
    static derivation_formatter* new_tree_derivation_formatter(const derivator* derinet);
    static derivation_formatter* new_derivation_formatter(string_piece name, const derivator* derinet);
  };

The derivation_formatter class performs required morphological derivation and
formats the results using a single string field (i.e., directly in the lemma).


derivation_formatter::format_derivation
---------------------------------------

  virtual void format_derivation(std::string& lemma) const = 0;

Perform the required morphological derivation and format the result back
directly in the lemma.


derivation_formatter::new_none_derivation_formatter
---------------------------------------------------

  static derivation_formatter* new_none_derivation_formatter();

Return a new derivation_formatter instance which does nothing (i.e., it performs
no derivation).


derivation_formatter::new_root_derivation_formatter
---------------------------------------------------

  static derivation_formatter* new_root_derivation_formatter(const derivator* derinet);

Return a new derivation_formatter instance which replaces a lemma by the
corresponding root in the derivation tree.


derivation_formatter::new_path_derivation_formatter
---------------------------------------------------

  static derivation_formatter* new_path_derivation_formatter(const derivator* derinet);

Return a new derivation_formatter instance which replaces a lemma by a space
separated path to the root in the morphological derivation tree (the original
lemma is first, followed by its parent, with the root being the last one).


derivation_formatter::new_tree_derivation_formatter
---------------------------------------------------

  static derivation_formatter* new_tree_derivation_formatter(const derivator* derinet);

Return a new derivation_formatter instance which appends to the lemma the whole
morphological derivation tree which contains it.

The tree is encoded in the following way: root node is the first, then the
subtrees of the root children are encoded recursively (each after one space),
followed by a final space (which denotes that the children are complete).


derivation_formatter::new_derivation_formatter
----------------------------------------------

  static derivation_formatter* new_derivation_formatter(string_piece name, const derivator* derinet);

Return one of the available derivation_formatter instances according to the name
parameter:
- none: return new_none_derivation_formatter instance
- root: return new_root_derivation_formatter instance
- path: return new_path_derivation_formatter instance
- tree: return new_tree_derivation_formatter instance


Class morpho
------------

  class morpho {
   public:
    virtual ~morpho() {}

    static morpho* load(const char* fname);
    static morpho* load(istream& is);

    enum guesser_mode { NO_GUESSER = 0, GUESSER = 1 };

    virtual int analyze(string_piece form, guesser_mode guesser, std::vector<tagged_lemma>& lemmas) const = 0;
    virtual int generate(string_piece lemma, const char* tag_wildcard, guesser_mode guesser, std::vector<tagged_lemma_forms>& forms) const = 0;

    virtual int raw_lemma_len(string_piece lemma) const = 0;
    virtual int lemma_id_len(string_piece lemma) const = 0;
    virtual int raw_form_len(string_piece form) const = 0;

    virtual tokenizer* new_tokenizer() const = 0;

    virtual const derivator* get_derivator() const;
  };

A morpho instance represents a morphological dictionary. Such a dictionary allow
morphological analysis, morphological generation provide information about lemma
structure and provides a suitable tokenizer. All methods are thread-safe.


morpho::load(const char*)
-------------------------

  static morpho* load(const char* fname);

Factory method constructor. Accepts C string with a file name of the model.
Returns a pointer to an instance of morpho which the user should delete after
use.


morpho::load(istream&)
----------------------

  static morpho* load(istream& is);

Factory method constructor. Accepts an input stream with the model. Returns a
pointer to an instance of morpho which the user should delete after use.


morpho::guesser_mode
--------------------

  enum guesser_mode { NO_GUESSER = 0, GUESSER = 1 };

Guesser mode defines behavior in case of unknown words. When set to GUESSER,
morpho tries to guess unknown words. When set to NO_GUESSER, morpho does not
guess unknown words.


morpho::analyze()
-----------------

  virtual int analyze(string_piece form, guesser_mode guesser, std::vector<tagged_lemma>& lemmas) const = 0;

Perform morphological analysis of a form. The guesser parameter specifies
whether a guesser can be used if the form is not found in the dictionary. Output
is assigned to the lemmas vector.

If the form is found in the dictionary, analyses are assigned to lemmas and
NO_GUESSER returned. If guesser == GUESSER and the form analyses are found using
a guesser, they are assigned to lemmas and GUESSER is returned.  Otherwise -1 is
returned and lemmas are filled with one analysis containing given form as lemma
and a tag for unknown word.


morpho::generate()
------------------

  virtual int generate(string_piece lemmma, const char* tag_wildcard, guesser_mode guesser, std::vector<tagged_lemma_forms>& forms) const = 0;

Perform morphological generation of a lemma. Optionally a tag_wildcard can be
specified (or be NULL) and if so, results are filtered using this wildcard. The
guesser parameter speficies whether a guesser can be used if the lemma is not
found in the dictionary. Output is assigned to the forms vector.

Tag_wildcard can be either NULL or a wildcard applied to the results. A ? in the
wildcard matches any character, [bytes] matches any of the bytes and [^bytes]
matches any byte different from the specified ones. A - has no special meaning
inside the bytes and if ] is first in bytes, it does not end the bytes group.

If the given lemma is only a raw lemma, all lemma ids with this raw lemma are
returned. Otherwise only matching lemma ids are returned, ignoring any lemma
comments. For every found lemma, matching forms are filtered using the
tag_wildcard. If at least one lemma is found in the dictionary, NO_GUESSER is
returned. If guesser == GUESSER and the lemma is found by the guesser, GUESSER
is returned. Otherwise, forms are cleared and -1 is returned.


morpho::raw_lemma_len
---------------------

  virtual int raw_lemma_len(string_piece lemma) const = 0;

When given a lemma returned by the dictionary, returns the length of a raw lemma
(see Lemma Structure).


morpho::lemma_id_len
--------------------

  virtual int lemma_id_len(string_piece lemma) const = 0;

When given a lemma returned by the dictionary, returns the length of a raw lemma
plus a lemma id (see Lemma Structure). Therefore, the substring of the original
lemma of this length is a unique lemma identifier. The rest of the original
lemma are lemma comments which do not identify the lemma.


morpho::raw_form_len
--------------------

  virtual int raw_form_len(string_piece form) const = 0;

When given a form, returns the length of a raw form. This is used only in
external morphology model, where form contains also morphological analyses, and
this call can return the length of the form without the analyses.


morpho::new_tokenizer
---------------------

  virtual tokenizer* new_tokenizer() const = 0;

Returns a new instance of a suitable tokenizer or NULL if no such tokenizer
exists. The user should delete it after use.

Note that the tokenizer might use the morpho instance, so the tokenizer must not
be used after the morpho instance is destructed.


morpho::get_derivator
---------------------

  virtual const derivator* get_derivator() const;

Returns a derivator for the morphology, or NULL if not available.

The derivator is owned by the morphology, so the returned instance should not be
freed and it cannot be used after the morpho instance is destructed.


Class tagger
------------

  class tagger {
   public:
    virtual ~tagger() {}

    static tagger* load(const char* fname);
    static tagger* load(istream& is);

    virtual const morpho* get_morpho() const = 0;

    virtual void tag(const std::vector<string_piece>& forms, std::vector<tagged_lemma>& tags, morpho::guesser_mode guesser = -1) const = 0;

    virtual void tag_analyzed(const std::vector<string_piece>& forms, std::vector<std::vector<tagged_lemma> >& analyses, std::vector<int>& tags) const = 0;

    tokenizer* new_tokenizer() const = 0;
  };

A tagger instance represents a tagger, which perform disambiguation of
morphological analyses. All methods are thread-safe.


tagger::load(const char*)
-------------------------

  static tagger* load(const char* fname);

Factory method constructor. Accepts C string with a file name of the model.
Returns a pointer to an instance of tagger which the user should delete after
use.


tagger::load(istream&)
----------------------

  static tagger* load(istream& is);

Factory method constructor. Accepts an input stream with the model. Returns a
pointer to an instance of tagger which the user should delete after use.


tagger::get_morpho()
--------------------

  virtual const morpho* get_morpho() const = 0;

Returns a pointer to an instance of morpho associated with the tagger. Do not
delete the pointer, it is owned by the tagger instance and deleted in the tagger
destructor.


tagger::tag()
-------------

  virtual void tag(const std::vector<string_piece>& forms, std::vector<tagged_lemma>& tags, morpho::guesser_mode guesser = -1) const = 0;

Perform morphological analysis and subsequent disambiguation. Accepts a
std::vector of string_piece and fills the output vector of tagged_lemma.

The `guesser` parameter defines whether morphological guesser should be used. If
negative value is specified (which is the default), the guesser settings
employed when the tagger model was trained is used.


tagger::tag_analyzed()
----------------------

  virtual void tag_analyzed(const std::vector<string_piece>& forms, std::vector<std::vector<tagged_lemma> >& analyses, std::vector<int>& tags) const = 0;

Perform morphological disambiguation using given morphological analyses. The
indices of chosen analyses are stored in the output vector tags.

None of the analyses can be empty - in that case, no operation is performed and
tags is empty. On the other hand, the analyses vector can be larger than forms -
additional entries are ignored in that case.

Note that the tagger was trained with a specific morphology - the more your
morphological analyses differ from the original ones, the worse the results will
be. One of the usages of tag_analyzed is to consider only a subset of
morphological analyses.


tagger::new_tokenizer
---------------------

  virtual tokenizer* new_tokenizer() const = 0;

Returns a new instance of a suitable tokenizer or NULL if no such tokenizer
exists. The user should delete it after use.  The call is equal to
get_morpho()->new_tokenizer().


Class tagset_converter
----------------------

  class tagset_converter {
   public:
    virtual ~tagset_converter() {}

    virtual void convert(tagged_lemma& tagged_lemma) const = 0;
    virtual void convert_analyzed(std::vector<tagged_lemma>& tagged_lemmas) const = 0;
    virtual void convert_generated(std::vector<tagged_lemma_forms>& forms) const = 0;

    static tagset_converter* new_identity_converter();
    static tagset_converter* new_pdt_to_conll2009_converter();
    static tagset_converter* new_strip_lemma_comment_converter(const morpho& dictionary);
    static tagset_converter* new_strip_lemma_id_converter(const morpho& dictionary);
  };


tagset_converter::convert()
---------------------------

  virtual void convert(tagged_lemma& tagged_lemma) const = 0;

Convert the given tagged lemma.


tagset_converter::convert_analyzed()
------------------------------------

  virtual void convert_analyzed(std::vector<tagged_lemma>& tagged_lemmas) const = 0;

Convert the given results of morpho::analyze. Apart from calling convert, any
repeated entries are removed.


tagset_converter::convert_generated()
-------------------------------------

  virtual void convert_generated(std::vector<tagged_lemma_forms>& forms) const = 0;

Convert the given results of morpho::generate. Apart from calling convert, any
repeated entries are removed.


tagset_converter::new_identity_converter()
------------------------------------------

  static tagset_converter* new_identity_converter();

Returns a new instance of an identity converter. All convert methods of an
identity converter do nothing. The user should delete the instance after use.


tagset_converter::new_pdt_to_conll2009_converter()
--------------------------------------------------

  static tagset_converter* new_pdt_to_conll2009_converter();

Returns a new instance of a Czech PDT tag set to CoNLL2009 tag set converter.
The user should delete the instance after use.

CoNLL2009 tag set uses two columns for tags - one is a POS and the other one are
additional FEATs. Because we have only one tag field, we merge these fields
together by using Pos=?|FEAT, i.e., the POS is stored as a first FEAT.


tagset_converter::new_strip_lemma_comment_converter()
-----------------------------------------------------

  static tagset_converter* new_strip_lemma_comment_converter(const morpho& dictionary);

Returns a new instance of a tag set converter stripping lemma comment using the
given morpho instance, which must remain valid during existence of the tag set
converter. The user should delete the tag set converter instance after use.


tagset_converter::new_strip_lemma_id_converter()
------------------------------------------------

  static tagset_converter* new_strip_lemma_id_converter(const morpho& dictionary);

Returns a new instance of a tag set converter stripping lemma id using the given
morpho instance, which must remain valid during existence of the tag set
converter. The user should delete the tag set converter instance after use.


C++ Bindings API
----------------

Bindings for other languages than C++ are created using SWIG from the C++
bindings API, which is a slightly modified version of the native C++ API. Main
changes are replacement of string_piece type by native strings and removal of
methods using istream. Here is the C++ bindings API declaration:

  typedef vector<int> Indices;

  typedef vector<string> Forms;

  struct TaggedForm {
    string form;
    string tag;
  };

C# Bindings
-----------

MorphoDiTa library bindings is available in the Ufal.MorphoDiTa namespace.

The bindings is a straightforward conversion of the C++ bindings API. The
bindings requires native C++ library libmorphodita_csharp (called
morphodita_csharp on Windows).


Java Bindings
-------------

MorphoDiTa library bindings is available in the cz.cuni.mff.ufal.morphodita
package.

The bindings is a straightforward conversion of the C++ bindings API. Vectors do
not have native Java interface, see cz.cuni.mff.ufal.morphodita.Forms class for
reference. Also, class members are accessible and modifiable using using
getField and setField wrappers.

The bindings require native C++ library libmorphodita_java (called
morphodita_java on Windows). If the library is found in the current directory,
it is used, otherwise standard library search process is used.


Perl Bindings
-------------

MorphoDiTa library bindings is available in the Ufal::MorphoDiTa
(http://search.cpan.org/~straka/Ufal-MorphoDiTa/) package. The classes can be
imported into the current namespace using the :all export tag.

The bindings is a straightforward conversion of the C++ bindings API. Vectors do
not have native Perl interface, see Ufal::MorphoDiTa::Forms for reference.
Static methods and enumerations are available only through the module, not
through object instance.


Python Bindings
---------------

MorphoDiTa library bindings is available in the ufal.morphodita
(http://pypi.python.org/pypi/ufal.morphodita) module.

The bindings is a straightforward conversion of the C++ bindings API. In Python
2, strings can be both unicode and UTF-8 encoded str, and the library always
produces unicode. In Python 3, strings must be only str.
